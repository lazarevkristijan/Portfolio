The project consists of 5 main sections 
1. Hero
2. AboutMe
3. Projects
4. Skills
5. Contact

There are 2 smaller sections
1. Navbar
2. Footer

//

- Hero consists of the introductory content of the page, a picture of me,
and some interesting addons to it

- About section has the true introduction, an brief but wide description
of who I am, including a downloadable PDF Portfolio

- Projects is where I show some examples of some projects I've built,
inludibg a github and live url button to check it live and the repository

- Skills will tell you more about my competences, what I've learnt so far,
and how much I know which tool, and some certifications i have acquired
!!!The ranges shown there go from Bad to Good, not to Professional!
as it might seem. 

- Contact, where you can find me to connect.

- The navbar and footer are small sections and they add some meaning 
and accessability to the project

//

I have a couple of reusable components that can be slightly modified
accordingly to the specific sitaution. They have default colors and sizes
to maintain consistency.

They are:
1. Button
2. CertificationCard
3. ContactDetail
4. Flag
5. Heading
6. ProjectCard
7. SkillCard

The index.js is used to combine them all into one file for simpler importing

//

The public folder includes all the necessary pictures & icons used in the project,

Tailwind classes are typed in by a scheme
- First come colors, second are text styles, third come margins / paddings,
last comes widths and heights. Anything else has no particular order while
it is made sto be understandable anyway because there are only just a few

As the screen width gets smaller, the text will get accordingly smaller to fit
and look good on all devices.
